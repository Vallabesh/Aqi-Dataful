# 🧾 About the Project : "AirPure Innovations" is a startup born out of the air quality crisis in India, with 14 cities ranking among the world’s top 20 most polluted urban centers. Before investing in manufacturing and R&D, AirPure Innovations needed to know if their product vision matched real market needs.
They wanted clear, data-backed answers to:
-- Which pollutants must the purifier be designed to tackle?
-- What features would make it stand out in a crowded market?
-- Which cities offer the largest and most urgent demand?

# 🎯My Approach
 Using AQI data provided by Dataful I developed a 5-page Power BI dashboard that answered:
 
-- Priority cities with the highest “Air Quality Risk Scores”

-- Correlation between AQI spikes & pediatric asthma admissions

-- Gaps in competitor features (e.g., smart AQI syncing, VOC sensors)

-- Which months consistently show the worst air quality across Indian states

-- Which age group is most affected by air pollution-related health outcomes

-- Regional pollutant patterns to guide feature design

# Key Insights

 📍 Delhi, Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Mumbai emerged as top-tier markets, but Tier-2 cities like Howrah and Agra showed strong latent demand.
 
 🧪 PM2.5 and PM10 were the top pollutants to target across regions.
 
 ⚙️ Feature gaps included compact high-CADR designs and affordable VOC sensors.
 
🔥 The Impact
These findings will directly guide AirPure’s product design, pricing, and launch strategy, ensuring every rupee in R&D is spent where it matters most.
It was a rewarding experience to combine data analysis + market research to influence a product roadmap.
I would like to thank Dhaval Patel , Hemanand Vadivel, Dataful and Codebasics for providing me with this oppurtunity
